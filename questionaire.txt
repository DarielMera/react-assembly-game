  Project planning:
  
  Questions to ask yourself before writing any code:
  
  ------------ What are the main containers of elements I need
    in this app?
    - main overall container for the game
    - h1 for the tiltle
    - p for description of game

    -array of languages 
   - div languages container
    - buttons component rendered based on laguages array
    - 

    - 5 text inputs
    - probably a component distributed 5 times
    -im not sure if this is input or just a div or span designed with grid 5 columns
    -

    -array of 26 alphabet characters 
    -alphabet letter component rendered based on alphabet array
  
  ---------- What values will need to be saved in state vs.
    what values can be derived from the state?
  
    save state input textboxes values
    derived state: languages
    derived state: the alphabet letters

  
  ------------- How will the user interact with the app? What
    events do I need to handle?
    2. onclick
            > check if clicked letter is part of hidden word
                > if no then mark red and loose 1 language by disabling(opacity) and mark with skull and display RIP the current lost language name
                > if letter Is part of hidden word then display letter in the right square(s)(if appear more than nonce) change key color to green
                > keyboard keus

    gameWon variable 
        > if game is won then show new game buttons and display you win message on statusboard
    onClick event   > when new game button is pressed reset all game
        > keep state of count for failed clicked letters.. maximun of 8 attemps
    
note: the game will select random words
        > probably use math.random() to select a random index from provided array of words
